					 A Coming Of Age, Fiction, Jewish book. Know that...there&#39;s plenty of food and of course popcorn on the dining-room table. Just...help yourself....
				</p>
				<p class="description">
					It&#39;s 1977. Jacob Green, a Jewish kid from suburban New Jersey, sits on the stairs during his family&#39;s housewarming party, waiting for his father, Abram--charming host, everyone&#39;s best friend, and amateur emcee--to introduce him to the crowd. Housewarming parties, Annie Hall parties, and bar mitzvah parties punctuate Jacob&#39;s childhood and require command performances by all the Green family members. But when the confetti settles and the drapes are drawn, the affable Abram Green becomes an egotistical tyrant whose emotional rages rupture the lives of his family.Jacob doesn&#39;t mean to disappoint his father, but he can&#39;t help thinking the most unthinkable (and very funny) thoughts about public-school humiliation, Hebrew-school disinclination, and in-home sex education (with the live-in nanny!). If only his mother hadn&#39;t started college at thirty-six (and fallen for her psychology professor). If only he were more like his rebellious older brother (suspended from Hebrew school for drawing the rabbi in a threesome with a lobster and a pig). If only Jacob could confront his overbearing...

				<h3>More About <span>The Unthinkable Thoughts of Jacob Green</span></h3>
				<p>If only there was enough space on this tiny card to evoke my unfettered joie de vivre for what you have done. The gaiety, the mirth, the heavenly bubbling of every effusive cell that sings inside me for your kind and pithy offering. Joshua Braff, The Unthinkable Thoughts of Jacob Green // One&#39;s &#39;thing&#39;--(1) A point of personal interest; a hobby, sport, or avocation that succinctly defines a person. (2) A brief coupling of words used to evoke someone&#39;s personality in a small-talk setting: Billy&#39;s thing used to be soccer; now it&#39;s masterbation. (3) A laconic summation of one&#39;s character and interests used for the purpose of categorization and judgement. See also &#39;What do you do? Joshua Braff, The Unthinkable Thoughts of Jacob Green // Know that...there&#39;s plenty of food and of course popcorn on the dining-room table. Just...help yourself. If that runs out just let me know. Don&#39;t panic. And there&#39;s coffee, both caff and decaf, and soft drinks and juice in the kitchen, and plenty of ice in the freezer so...let me know if you have any questions with that.&#39; And lastly, since I have you all here in one place, I have something to share with you. Along the garden ways just now...I too heard the flowers speak. They told me that our family garden has all but turned to sand. I want you to know...</p>
				<p>I&#39;m torn between 3 and 4 stars here. This book (written by Zach Braff&#39;s older brother) presents itself as a funny, coming of age story of a Jewish boy and his quirky story but in actuality it&#39;s a good deal darker than that. Jacob&#39;s father longs for the perfect Jewish family and the perfect Jewish son who will represent him on the beema... If it was possible to give something half stars, I would give this 4.5. It was super well written, funny at times. Braff is really good at &#34;showing not telling&#34;. The characters were awesome and believable. The minus half a star is for the ending, which I didn&#39;t really like. It wasn&#39;t a bad ending at all, it was just a bit... unsatisfying.... I remember reading about sexual things. It may have been masturbation. Yes that was it.</p>
