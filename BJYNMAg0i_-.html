				<p class="description">
					Ray Bradbury&#39;s moving recollection of a vanished golden era remains one of his most enchanting novels. Dandelion Wine stands out in the Bradbury literary canon as the author&#39;s most deeply personal work, a semi-autobiographical recollection of a magical small-town summer in 1928. Twelve-year-old Douglas Spaulding knows Green Town, Illinois, is as vast and deep as the whole wide world that lies beyond the city limits. It is a pair of brand-new tennis shoes, the first harvest of dandelions for Grandfather&#39;s renowned intoxicant, the distant clang of the trolley&#39;s bell on a hazy afternoon. It is yesteryear and tomorrow blended into an unforgettable always. But as young Douglas is about to discover, summer can be more than the repetition of established rituals whose mystical power holds time at bay. It can be a best friend moving away, a human time machine who can transport you back to the Civil War, or a sideshow automaton able to glimpse the bittersweet future. Come and savor Ray Bradbury&#39;s priceless distillation of all that is...

				<h3>More About <span>Dandelion Wine</span></h3>
				<p>A long time back, she thought, I dreamed a dream, and was enjoying it so much when someone wakened me, and that day I was born. And now? Now, let me see...She cast her mind back. Where was I? she thought. Ninety years...how to take up the thread and the pattern of that lost dream again? She put out a small hand. There...yes, that was it. She smiled. Deeper in the warm snow hill she turned her head upon her pillow. That was better. Now, yes, now she saw it shaping in her mind quietly, and with a serenity like a sea moving along an endless and self-refreshing... Where would you like to go, what would you really like to do with your life? See Istanbul, Port Said, Nairobi, Budapest. Write a book. Smoke too many cigarettes. Fall off a cliff but get caught in a tree halfway down. Get shot at a few times in a dark alley on a Morrocan midnight. Love a beautiful woman. Ray Bradbury, Dandelion Wine // Trains and boxcars and the smell of coal and fire are not ugly to children. Ugliness is a concept that we happen on later and become self-conscious about. Ray Bradbury, Dandelion Wine //</p>
				<p>&#34;Dandelion Wine.... The words were summer on the tongue&#34;. We all love to travel, one way or another. That&#39;s why we read! To experience time; To experience new worlds; To experience...And sometimes, we find those peculiar time machines that take us to somewhere special. Let&#39;s say, a reminiscent of nostalgic childhood. That one is always... The only reason I gave this book five stars was because I couldn&#39;t give it five thousand.I can&#39;t express how beautiful this book is. I&#39;ve never cried so hard (no, not even when Mrs. Johnson read us &#34;Where the Red Fern Grows&#34; in the third grade), nor have I felt so much love from a bunch of grouped together, sixty-year-old, courier-fonted... Yayorum lan. Hayatta olmak ok gzel. O kadar fazla duygu var ki deneyimlenecek yeterli vaktim olmama ihtimali korkutuyor.Aynen bu ekilde lk atan bir kitap okudum. Okunmal hatta ee dosta okutmal.</p>
