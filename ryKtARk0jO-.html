					How can we expect to find happiness and meaning in our lives when the modern world seems such an unhappy place? His Holiness the Dalai Lama has suffered enormously throughout his life, yet he always seems to be smiling and serene. How does he do it? In The Art of Happiness in a Troubled World, Dr. How­ard Cutler walks listeners through the Dalai Lama&#39;s philosophy on how to achieve peace of mind and come to terms with...

				<h3>More About <span>The Art of Happiness in a Troubled World</span></h3>
				<p>Serious questions were at stake: Is it possible to be truly happy when social problems invariably impact our personal happiness? In seeking happiness do we choose the path of inner development or social change? As Dalai Lama XIV, The Art of Happiness in a Troubled World // Every night, millions of Americans spend their free hours watching television rather than engaging in any form of social interaction. What are they watching? In recent years we have seen reality television become the most popular form of television programming. To discover the nature of our current reality, we might consider examples such as Survivor, the series that helped spawn the reality TV revolution. Every week tens of millions of viewers watched as a group of ordinary people stranded in some isolated place struggled to meet various challenges... I believe the very purpose of our life is to seek happiness. Whether one believes in religion or not, whether one believes in that religion or this religion, we are all seeking something better in life. So, I think, the very motion of our life is towards happiness... Dalai Lama XIV, The Art of Happiness in a Troubled World //</p>
				<p>Theres way too much of Cutler&#39;s thoughts and not enough of the Dalai Lama. This is more an advertisement for the books written by Cutler and a vehicle for sharing his world view with the express hope that the Dalai Lama would agree with him. Cutler&#39;s isnt an opinion Id ordinarily care for and I had to give up when his unwitting condescending... poorly written. the manner the author approaches the subject and how he formulates the questions for Dalai Lama are childish. You can just skip to the last chapter of the book and you wouldn&#39;t miss a thing. Like another reviewer said, they wasted space talking about when the Dalai Lama took a tea break, etc. It was like an interview where a psychologist wanted to see if he could crush the spirit of the Dalai Lama. It brings up the point of people will typically be happier if they view the people as generally good instead of generally bad...</p>
