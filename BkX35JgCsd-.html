				<p>And then I should get no brains,&#34; said the Scarecrow. &#34;And I should get no courage,&#34; said the Cowardly Lion. &#34;And I should get no heart,&#34; said the Tin Woodman. &#34;And I should never get back to Kansas,&#34; said Dorothy. L. Frank Baum, The Complete Oz // All the same,&#34; said the Scarecrow, &#34;I shall ask for brains instead of a heart; for a fool would not know what to do with a heart if he had one.&#34; &#34;I shall take the heart,&#34; returned the Tin Woodman; &#34;for brains do not make one happy, and happiness is the best thing in the world. L. Frank Baum, The Complete Wizard of Oz Collection: All 22 Stories With Active Table of Contents // But I do not wish to fight,&#34; declared Ozma, firmly. &#34;No one has the right to destroy any living creatures, however evil they may be, or to hurt them or make them unhappy. L. Frank Baum, The Complete Oz //</p>

I&#39;ve been a huge Oz fan since my early teen years, and I am a collector of the vintage books, and fan, still. This series is wonderful for the young and the young at heart. I love reading them with my children. For me the stories never get old. Some of the books in the series are better than others (I just chose this one, since it has... I read the first book many years ago as and loved it. When I discovered the entire series in a Kindle version I was quite pleased. The rest of the books are as charming as the first. I noticed a few discrepancies but in a book of fairy tales do they really matter? Anyone who hasn&#39;t outgrown a children&#39;s love for fairytales will be delighted...</p>
