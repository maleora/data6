				<h3>More About <span>Bitten</span></h3>
				<p>I remember hearing myself start to whimper, a five-year-old, crouched by the side of the road, staring into my father&#39;s eyes, whimpering because it was so dark and there was no one coming to help, whimpering because my mother was back in the crushed car, not moving, and my father was lying here in the dirt, not answering me, not holding me, not comforting me, not helping my mother get out of the car, and there was blood, so much blood, and broken glass everywhere, and it was so dark and so cold and no one was coming to help. Kelley Armstrong, Bitten... What&#39;s the woman doing there?&#34; he asked.&#34;Covering a scratch on the hood. She was cheaper than a new paint job.&#34;He flipped through a few more pages of barely dressed women and classic cars. &#34;Nick used to have magazines like this when we were kids. But without the cars.&#34; He rotated a photo sideways. &#34;Or the bathing suits. Kelley Armstrong, Bitten // You know, I couldn&#39;t imagine living somewhere without seasons.&#34;Yeah?&#34;Real seasons, I mean. I&#39;d miss the changes, the variety. Especially spring. I couldn&#39;t live without spring. Days like today are worth every snowstorm and slush puddle. By March, it seems like winter will never end. All that snow and ice that seemed so wonderful in December is driving you crazy. But you know spring&#39;s coming. Every year, you wait for that first warm day, then the next and the next, each better than the last. You can&#39;t help but be happy. You forget winter and get the chance...</p>
				<p>Her writing is always good, and I wasn&#39;t disappointed with the first adult book of hers that I&#39;ve read. It starts off a bit slow, but really picks up and becomes an excellently paced story with good suspense, great action and description. There&#39;s very strong characterization and great voice. At times electric and at others, emotionally... Apart from the fact that only Jericho Barrons could have rescued Bitten from a pool of mindboggling dullness, Armstrong&#39;s werewolves just didn&#39;t match my expectations *sulkily stripes away raw animalism, carnality, pack troubles, alpha fights, angst, werewolvish sex - whatever that may be..*. I actually caught myself longing for the... Had any of the characters been even half as cool as this guy:...I may have keep reading. Or to be more accurate I should say: I may have read it correctly. Which I didnt. Instead, I did this:*notices all the 5star reviews of Bitten**clicks confirm order button on BookDespository.com**waits by mail box for about 40,000 years**receives...</p>
